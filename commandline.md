The command line on a computer is a bit like what Elevator conductors were before we invented electric buttons or operators were before we invented switch boards for telephones.
Its a way that you can tell the computer what to do without all the visual cues like folders and a mouse.
It was the way nerds navigated around computers before it looked nice.

PWD - Print Working Directory
Shows what directory/folder you are in, in the computer

mkdir - make a new directory
Creates a new directory/folder

rmdir - remove directory
Deletes a chosen directory/folder

Hostname - computer network name
tells you the computers name

cd - change directory
moves you to another directory/folder

ls - List directory
Lists all the files inside your current directory location - this means all things, folders, pictures, mp3's etc.

pushd - push directory
This stores selected directory's for use later.
It is possible to set a function that the comouter will execute and this will occur though your stored folders (pushed through).

mv - move file or directory
Pretty self explainatory

find - find files
Search for files

cat - Print file
Puts what ever is in a file on screen

touch - make empty file
Creates a new file with nothing in it - you can name it too i.e touch samisrad.txt
